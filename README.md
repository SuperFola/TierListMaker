# TierListMaker

A fun side-project to make tier lists in your browser.

## Features

- drag-to-upload (one or more images)
- drag and drop images between tiers to reorder them
- drag and drop images within a tier to reorder inside of a tier
- change the color of a given tier
- stretch (to a square) or not an image when uploading it using the `+`
- export as an image
- everything stays in your browser, nothing is uploaded to the server: you keep your data
- dynamic tier names

## Launching

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SuperFola/TierListMaker.git
cd TierListMaker/
python -m http.server
```

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/
